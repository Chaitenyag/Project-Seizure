# Project-Seizure
Inspiration
More than 50 million people all over the world suffer from seizures causing diseases, gradually becoming isolated from their environment. Eventually, the patient reaches such a stage when he is no longer capable to nurture himself and is completely reliant on others. However, this is where our project steps in.

What it does
It is a novel, innovative, and economic approach towards notifying the occurrence of Seizures by identifying the changes produced in the patients heart rate. The program monitors a person's heart rate, and if it spiked irregularly (meaning a minor or a major seizure) then it would send a notification to their emergency contact and depending on the severity, it would send a SOS to the police, along with a report to the patients doctor.

How we built it
We used python for the back-end and also used Twilio's API. For the front-end we used PHP, HTML, CSS and Google Maps API.

Challenges we ran into
Figuring out how to graph using python, and how to send images and the locations of a person to a database.
